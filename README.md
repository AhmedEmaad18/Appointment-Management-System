# Health

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.3.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Project Overview
This project is an appointment registration system that allows patients to register appointments with doctors. The application is built using Angular for the frontend and Node.js for the backend.

Approach
I approached this project by first outlining the requirements and then designing the user interface using Angular components. I utilized Angular's reactive forms for form handling and validation.

What I Liked:

The modularity of Angular made it easy to manage components and services.
The use of RxJS for handling asynchronous data streams was powerful and efficient.
What I Didnâ€™t Like:

Initial setup and configuration of Angular can be overwhelming for beginners.
Debugging asynchronous code can sometimes be challenging.
Challenges Faced:

Integrating the backend with the frontend required careful handling of API calls and error management.
Ensuring proper form validation and user feedback was a bit tricky but ultimately rewarding.
Pending Tasks:
Implement appointment conflict checking to prevent double bookings.
Improve UI/UX with better styling and responsive design.
Write unit tests for components and services to ensure code quality.
Deploy the application to a cloud service (e.g., Heroku, AWS).
Testing
To ensure the quality of the application, unit tests and end-to-end tests can be run using the following commands:
